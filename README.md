# Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

This project demonstrates how to predict stock prices using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. LSTMs are powerful for time series forecasting tasks as they can effectively capture the sequential dependencies in data. The model is trained on historical stock price data and deployed as a web app using Streamlit.

## Features

- **Time Series Forecasting**: Predicts future stock prices based on past data.
- **LSTM Neural Network**: Trained to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data.
- **Interactive Web App**: Deployed on HuggingFace Spaces using Streamlit.

## Live Demo

## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras (for LSTM model)
- Streamlit (for web app deployment)
- HuggingFace Spaces (for hosting the app)
